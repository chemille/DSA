# Since LLs are not stored in continguous memory, most read and write operations will 
# require us to traverse the list, meaning we must follow the pointers to travel from 
# one node to the next. With a SLL, we also maintain a reference to the head node, so 
# all of our traversal will start at the head of the list.
